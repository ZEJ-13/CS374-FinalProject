## Proposal

Pathway is a financial assistant app for college students who wish to improve their financial literacy and make informed decisions about their money. Pathway allows users to track their income and manage their expenses to achieve their financial goals. With a streamlined design, our app is solely dedicated to empowering our users to make smart decisions about their money, using only the information authorized to us by the user.

## Audience / Persona

Pathway is aimed at college students who are struggling with their finances.

Here are some examples of users who may use our app:

 Sarah is a busy college student who enjoys her daily coffee. However, she has recently felt that her coffee spending has been cutting into her ability to afford healthy and balanced meals. With Pathway, Sarah can easily track how much she spends on food and coffee each week, and make adjustments accordingly.

 Jack is a dedicated art student who likes to experiment with different types of mediums. Whenever he has a big new project in mind, Jack can use Pathway to track his expenses and save for materials and supplies needed for his next masterpiece.

 ## Features

- Users can create an account for free!

- Users can input information about their expenses, such as the type of expense and how much it costs.

- Users can also input information about their income, such as how this income was received and how much was earned.

- Users can access this information at any time and rest easy knowing that this information is safely stored using Google Firebase.

- Additional features that can be included are: long-term and short-term goals, articles contributed by Pathway editors, and additional security features.

 ## Existing Solutions

Wally is a financial status tracker that allows the user to connect various accounts and see graphical breakdowns of their financial situation. Wally also allows the user to make custom budgets and goals. Unlike Wally, our app design is more streamlined and only uses information granted to it by the user (no connection to external accounts)

Mint is another financial status tracker, similar to Wally. It offers more advanced features, like credit score. Our app is more simplistic and does not display potentially sensitive information the user does not want to share.

 ## Utilizations

Pathway utilizes Google Firebase in order to authenticate users and store user information.
